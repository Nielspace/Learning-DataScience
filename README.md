Learning DataScience is tutorial repository teaching you how to learning the fundamental concepts of data science. Ofcourse 
learning anything new will take time and mastering it may take years as well. The key point is to be consistent and to record
your progress month by month. 

The timeline I am creating will give you a simple idea as to how to structure your data science cirruculum. And even if you miss
out on anything you can revisit this repo to get back on track.

# What is Data Science?

By *Data Science*, we mean almost anything that has to do with *data*: collecting the data, analysing,
modelling. Yet the most importtant part is the application. Like machine learning. 

Eventhough the Artificial Intelligence was born in 1956. The research almost hit a road bloc. Like dead-end. Suddenly the 
shadow of dawn stood still in the vicinity of a great break through. 

With the rise of data it made it possible to train machine with a data driven approach rather than a knowlegde driven
approach. Data became the new fuel of the industry. Suddenly all the theories of Artificial Neural Nets, Perceptrons, Multi-layer 
perceptron became possible. 

Data mining which is a field of statistic where important and insightful information is fetched or gathered from the data. 
In other words data mining is used to extract information, patterns and reasons from the data and transform the 
information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the "knowledge discovery in 
databases" process, or KDD. 

Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference 
considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and 
online updating.

With massive computer power we can now use computer science to mine the data. 

Hence, **Data Science = Data Mining + Computer Science**
