# About

Learning Data science is tutorial repository teaching you how to learning the fundamental concepts of data science. Ofcourse 
learning anything new will take time and mastering it may take years as well. The key point is to be consistent and to record
your progress month by month. 

The timeline I am creating will give you a simple idea as to how to structure your data science cirruculum. And even if you miss
out on anything you can revisit this repo to get back on track.

# What is DataScience?

By *Data Science*, we mean almost anything that has to do with *data*: **collecting the data, analysing,
modelling**. Yet the most importtant part is the application. Like machine learning. 

Eventhough the Artificial Intelligence was born in 1956. The research almost hit a road block. Like dead-end. Suddenly the 
shadow of dawn stood still in the vicinity of a great break through. 

With the rise of data it made it possible to train machine with a data driven approach rather than a knowlegde driven
approach. Data became the new fuel for the industry. Suddenly all the theories of Artificial Neural Nets, Perceptrons, Multi-layer perceptron became possible. 

With data as a fuel we can now build recomendation machines like we see in Youtube, Netflix, Amazon and so on. We can also 
build self driving cars. We can build a voice assistance like Alexa and Siri and much more. 

But before it came into being we still had few mysteries to unfold. Starting with Data Mining.

**Data mining** which is a field in statistic where important and insightful information is fetched or gathered from the data. 
In other words data mining is used to extract information, patterns, knowlegdge and reasons from the data and transform the 
information into a comprehensible structure for further use. Data mining is the analysis step of the "knowledge discovery in 
databases" process, or KDD. 

Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating. 

With data coming in abundance in this digital era we still needed tools to process this data, and we entered the world of AI and Machine Learning. With massive computer power, algorithms and ofcouse the inspiration from the structure of the human brain we can now use computer science to mine the data and process it according to our own desires.

Hence, **Data Science = Data Mining + Computer Science**

Where, data mining includes statistics, visualisation and computer science involves linear algebra, probability and algorithms.

# The Role of a Data Scientist

Well, it depends.

But, before that let’s look at the hierarchy of a data scientist.

![](images/datascience.png)

Basically the role of a data scientist is to do the following task:

- Explore/Transform
- Aggregate/Label
- Learn/Optimise

The above role is called a Data Analyst who deals mostly with Exploratory Analysis which means to find insightful patterns and hidden meaning from the data.

People who usually handles AI and deep learning part are mostly researchers also known as “research scientist”. Mostly people who are done with their masters and Phd get this role.

**Moving/storing** is taken care by the data engineers and software developer takes care of the data collection part.
I just want to make a note that the job titles may vary from company to company depending upon the size and also the financial infrastructure.
