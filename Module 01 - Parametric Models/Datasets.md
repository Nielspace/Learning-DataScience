# Dataset for practicing machine learning 

Datasets chosen and listed below are either very easy to start working with or have a lot of helpful kernels/notebook to get one started. 

For most part we will using the below mentioned dataset for learning datascience. We will be making use of Google Colab for learning, running and evaluating our models. 

**Why google colab???**
Because, we don't have to struggle with pip install and what not. Especially the storage part of the notebook. But, you are free to use your own local computer.
